Many possible dangers exist on the internet that should be overcome by parents, educational institutions and society in general. To anticipate the occurrence of these dangerous things on our children, the first step is to identify the various possible dangers faced by our children. After that, together with our parents we can take the next wise step, so that our children can still enjoy the various benefits offered by the internet.
This project serves that purpose by protecting our children from the danger of the internet and its bad influence on the youth of society if not being monitored by parents and adults in a general way.
